There are 2 `style` files and 2 `script` files generated by the **fabricator** engine:
1. The styles and scripts that are specific to rendering the style guide are called `f.css` and `f.jss`.
    * Guide-specific styles are useful for modifying the layout or behaviors within the guide without having those modifications carry over to the final toolkit files.
    * The source files for these scripts are located in the styles and scripts folders within `/src/assets/fabricator/`.
1. The styles and scripts meant for usage on Bluetooth products and production code are called `toolkit.css` and `toolkit.js`.
	* Styles and scripts meant for production will also be rendered and run within the style guide. You may need to take steps to `unbind()` your JavaScript functions within the guide-specific files (mentioned above) if **production code** is interfering with the guide.
    * The source files for "toolkit" styles and scripts are located in the styles and scripts folders within `/src/assets/toolkit/`.
    * The `toolkit.scss` file also imports `bootstrap` styles, which are located at `/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/`.
