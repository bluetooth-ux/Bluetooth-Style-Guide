Code highlighting is achieved with [Prism](http://prismjs.com/).

Wrap the code you want to highlight in a `<pre>` block to get mono-spacing and a subtle background color. Specify the code language with a class on the `<pre>` block. Example: `<pre class="language-markup">` for HTML or `<pre class="language-css">` for CSS.

See the [languages list](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list) for supported languages and class names.
